The original Cell Machine was created by Sam Hogan.
CelLua is a non-profit passion project created by KyYay that simply aims to add more content to the original idea.
CelLua Machine Wiki Mod is a modification of CelLua Machine to aid in documentation of the game for the CelLua Machine Wiki, created by aadenboy.
